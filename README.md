# Paging Simulation - Operating System Project

A web-based simulation tool for understanding memory paging in operating systems. This interactive tool allows users to visualize and experiment with virtual memory paging concepts.

## Features

- Interactive paging table configuration
- Virtual to physical address translation
- Binary and decimal number format support
- Visual representation of memory mappings
- Detailed calculation steps
- Responsive design for all devices

## Usage

1. Configure the paging table:
   - Set frame size (in bytes)
   - Set total number of frames
   - Set total virtual pages
   - Define initial page mappings

2. Enter a virtual address to:
   - See the translation process
   - View physical address calculation
   - Check for page faults
   - Visualize memory mappings

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Modern CSS features (CSS Variables, Flexbox, Grid)
- Responsive Design
